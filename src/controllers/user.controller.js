    - `req.files` is populated by the multer middleware.

//important note about file handling using multer 

/*
    ‚úÖ How multer works:
    - Multer is a middleware that handles `multipart/form-data`, which is primarily used for file uploads.
    - We configured multer to save uploaded files into a temporary folder (`/public/temp`).
    - Multer adds a `files` object to the `req` (request) object.
    - For each file field in the form, multer stores metadata including the `path` to the saved file.

    Example:
    If frontend uploads two files with keys `avatar` and `coverImage`, the structure of `req.files` will be:
    req.files = {
        avatar: [ { path: "path/to/file1.jpg", originalname: "...", ... } ],
        coverImage: [ { path: "path/to/file2.jpg", originalname: "...", ... } ]
    }

    Since each field is an array (even if it contains one file), we access the first item using `[0]`.

    Then we use `.path` to get the local path of the uploaded file on the server.

    This file path is passed to Cloudinary uploader.
    */
