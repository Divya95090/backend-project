// ðŸ“¦ Dev Dependencies:
// These are packages/tools we only need during development (e.g., for testing, linting, or building).
// They are NOT included when the project is deployed to production.
//
// âœ… Examples: nodemon, eslint, prettier, vite (in some setups)
//
// You install them using:
// npm install <package-name> --save-dev
// or
// yarn add <package-name> --dev
//
// ðŸ”’ This keeps the production build lighter and faster.
